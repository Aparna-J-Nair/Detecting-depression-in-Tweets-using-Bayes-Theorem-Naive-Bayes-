# Detecting-depression-in-Tweets-using-Bayes-Theorem-Naive-Bayes-
Nowadays risk of early death is increasing due to mental illness which is mostly caused due to depression. Depression creates suicidal thoughts causing serious impairments in daily life. Sentiment analysis is a hot topic that’s been on research for decades, which intends to find the nature of text and classifies into positive and negative. There are many restraints preventing expert care from reaching people suffering from depression in time. Impediments such as social stigma associated with mental disorders, lack of trained healthcare professionals and ignorance of the signs of depression owing to a lack of awareness of the disease. Based on a curated word list, the tweets are classified as positive or negative. 

The project comprises of the features extracted from combined effect of the all the processes like emotional, momentarily, grammatical for detecting and processing the depressive data which is retrieved from social media. Then pre-processing of the derived data is carried out. Pre-processing involves removing unnecessary words such as Removal of Stop words, Stemmization and Tokenization that are necessary for analysis. We may label the tweets with the scraped tweets whether it's positive or negative using naïve bayes classifier. The algorithm describes the flow of the work.

• Retrieve the data sets (Twitter / Twitter API / Facebook / Facebook API)
• Pre-processing to train the Naïve Bayesian Classifier. 
• Convert the data set in frequency table using TF-IDF (term frequency–inverse 
document frequency- it will reflect how important a word is to a document in a 
collection.) 
• Use the Naïve Bayesian rule for calculating depressed and non-depress words per 
comment / post.
• Classification into depress comments and non-depressed comments from total 
comments / POSTS.
